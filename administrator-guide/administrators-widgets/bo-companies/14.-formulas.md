# 14. Formulas

## Custom Formulas

On the fourteenth step of the company creation window — **Formulas** — you can configure custom formulas for calculating various figures.

Experience tells us that different companies have different formulas for the most common trading figures like **profit, loss**, **percentage change**, etc. If you're dissatisfied with the way ETNA Trader calculates certain figures, you may define your own formulas that meet your requirements. To add a new formula, click **Add formula**.

In the appeared pop-up window, specify the following parameters:

1. **Name**. This is the figure you want to re-define \(must be selected from the list\).
2. **Expression**. This is the formula for the re-defined figure.

When done click **OK**, and from now on the specified figure will be calculated according to the new formula.

## Formula Syntax

Custom formulas in ETNA Trader are parsed and evaluated by the [Javascript Expression Evaluator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expr-eval). This library can interpret basic Javascript expressions, but it's a little more math-oriented. For example, if you want to re-define the formula for price change, you should enter the required mathematical expression. For example:

```text
Last - PrevClose
```

where Last and PrevClose are ETNA Trader's variables. Some of these variables are fetched from the market data suppliers while others are computed with the help of the fetched variables.
