# Support Tickets

### Introduction

ETNA Trader provides powerful and versatile user feedback functionality that enables companies to receive, track, and respond to messages from their users. Whenever a user experiences some technical issue or wants to enquire about some widget, they can submit a troubleshooting ticket within the web terminal. This ticket is then registered in our system and you get notified about it via email or the **BO Support Tickets** widget.

Apart from email notifications and the support ticket widget, you can also integrate your own ticket management system like Zendesk or Freshdesk into ETNA Trader. That way our system will automatically send all user feedback to your ticket management system, where you can proceed to handle customer issues.

### Submitting User Feedback

Whenever a user needs technical assistance, they should file a troubleshooting report in ETNA Trader by clicking on the little question mark icon in the upper right-hand corner.

In the appeared pop-up window, they should describe the experienced issue and then click **Submit**. They could also optionally attach up to five files, each sized no more than 10 megabytes.

At the top there are two links: one for the user guide and the other for the video that your users can watch. Both of these links can be configured in the [**BO companies** widget](bo-companies/15.-headers.md), on the **Header** tab of the company modification window.
