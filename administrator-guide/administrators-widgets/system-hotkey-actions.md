# System Hotkey Actions

### Introduction

ETNA Trader provides rich shortcut functionality to users who'd like to streamline their trading routine with hotkeys. If you need to buy a security or cancel all active orders with a single press of a key â€” ETNA Trader enables you to configure such shortcuts for various events. The range of actions that can be mapped to keyboard keys is determined by administrators through the **System Hotkey Actions** widget. Once these actions are configured, users may proceed to map them to the preferred keys via the **Hotkeys** widget.
