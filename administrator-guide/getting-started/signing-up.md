# Signing Up

## Introduction

ETNA Trader provides two basic account types: **user** and **administrator**. Users have regular rights that authorize them to perform basic procedures like placing orders and analyzing markets; on top of that, administrators' rights include administrative privileges that enable them to create and manage users and companies, and so on.

To sign up for ETNA Trader as an administrator, you should first sign up as a regular user and then request administrator rights from the service provider. Once the rights are granted, you may proceed to create companies, create users, manage support tickets, and so on.
