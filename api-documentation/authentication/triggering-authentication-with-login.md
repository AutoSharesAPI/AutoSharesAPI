## Triggering authentication with /login

When visitors to your app visit the `/login` route, they'll be redirected to Auth0 to begin the authentication flow.

```
# ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your webappexample/views.py file.
```

```
Â 
```

```
def login(request):
```

```
Â Â  Â return oauth.auth0.authorize_redirect(
```

```
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  request, request.build_absolute_uri(reverse("callback"))
```

```
Â Â  Â )
```

## Finalizing authentication with /callback

After your users finish logging in with Auth0, they'll be returned to your application at the `/callback` route. This route is responsible for actually saving the session for the user, so when they visit again later, they won't have to sign back in all over again.

```
# ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your /views.py file.
```

```
Â 
```

```
def callback(request):
```

```
Â Â Â  token = oauth.auth0.authorize_access_token(request)
```

```
Â Â Â  request.session["user"] = token
```

```
Â Â  Â return redirect(request.build_absolute_uri(reverse("index")))
```

## To inquire User roles

You can use the following code sample:

`import requests`\
\
`url = "`[`https://dev-s2lge48ro4vtrqmv.us.auth0.com/api/v2/users/:id/roles`](https://dev-s2lge48ro4vtrqmv.us.auth0.com/api/v2/users/:id/roles)`"`\
\
`payload = {}`\
`headers = {`\
&#x20; `'Accept': 'application/json'`\
`}`\
\
`response = requests.request("GET", url, headers=headers, data=payload)`\
\
`print(response.text)`
