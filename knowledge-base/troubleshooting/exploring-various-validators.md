# Exploring Order Validators

### Introduction

In ETNA Trader, each transaction has to be validated by different validators to prevent unexpected incidents like purchasing a billion shares or placing an order from a trading account of a different user.  Every type of operations like placement of a new order and depositing new funds has its own spectre of validators that ensure that the operation is carried out properly without unintended consequences.

There are two types of validators: **core** validators and **custom** validators. Core validators are configured in a special configuration file \(.config\) that is set up by our [support team](mailto:support@etnasoft.com). Conversely, custom validators can be configured by the broker in ETNA Trader's Back Office located at admin.yourTradingPlatformDomain.com.

Every validator has its own priority which influences the order in which the validators are triggered. The validator with the highest priority is triggered first and the one with the lowest priority is triggered last. If an order fails even one validator, it will be rejected by the system, and the trader will see the following error message:

* Web terminal:

* Mobile app:
