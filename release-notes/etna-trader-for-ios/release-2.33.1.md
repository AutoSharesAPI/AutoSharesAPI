# Release 2.33.1

### Multithreading Enhancements

In release 2.33.1, ETNA Trader for iOS improves its implementation of multithreading, increasing the number of utilized threads by a factor of 10. This change applies to the entire spectre of operations performed in the app: retrieving charts, quotes, positions, orders, price alerts, etc. As a result, the performance of the app has been improved; for example, the load time for charts on the _Watchlists_ tab has been substantially reduced.

The improvements in multithreading are especially noticeable on the latest iPhones \(X, XS, XS Max, XR\) and iPad Pros. These devices feature hexa-core CPUs that can leverage all six cores to load up charts, retrieve quotes, and other user data.

ETNA Trader 2.33.1 for iOS is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/etna-trader/id658778917?mt=8).
