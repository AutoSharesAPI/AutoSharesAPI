# Get Filtered Equities

### Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to retrieve equites sorted by a specified field. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
In order to retrieve the a list of filtered equities, you must use an [authorization token]() of an administrator. Using authorization tokens of regular users will lead to the 401 status code.
{% endhint %}

There are seven required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** \(header\). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. It can be found it in the **BO Companies** widget. When editing the company's settings, navigate to the **WebApi** tab and look for the required key \(it could be a key for the web terminal, the mobile app, or a custom key\). 
2. **Authorization** \(header\). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request]().
3. **API version** \(path\). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **pageNumber** \(query\). This is the page number \(there are thousands of equities split into pages\).
5. **pageSize** \(query\). This is the number of equities that should be retrieved from this page. 
6. **sortField** \(query\). This is the field by which all equities should be sorted. For example, if you specify **Type**, first you'll receive stocks, then ETFs, etc.
7. **Desc** \(query\). This is a boolean field that indicates if the returned equities should be sorted in the descending order.

Here's the final template for this API request:

```text
GET apiURL/v1.0/equities?pageNumber=0&pageSize=2&sortField=Type&desc=true
```

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when attempting to retrieve sorted equities. 

#### Requesting as a Non-Administrator

One of the most common mistakes that developers make when making this API request is to use the authorization token of a non-administrator. It's critical to understand that in order to be eligible for retrieving sorted equities, the requester must be an administrator. Otherwise you'll receive the 401 status code with the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "Authorization has been denied for this request."
}
```

So be sure to use the authorization token generated with an administrator's credentials.

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Failing to Specify the Query Parameters

It's crucial to understand that all four query parameters must be indicated in the request; otherwise you'll receive the 404 status code and the following message:

```javascript
{
    "Message": "No HTTP resource was found that matches the request URI 'https://pub-api-etnatrader-dev.etnasoft.us/api/v1.0/equities?pageNumber=0&pageSize=2&sortField=Type'."
}
```
