# Requesting Tokens

### Introduction

In ETNA Trader, all API requests require a special authentication token to be provided in the header. Whether you want to create a price alert for a user, get a quote on a particular stock, or cancel an order â€” you first have to authorize the user with their unique token \(requests can only be made on behalf of some user\). This token can be generated by making a specific API call where you provide the user's username and their password. In response, you'll receive the above-mentioned token which can be used in all other requests.

Whenever you make such a request, a fresh token will be generated and returned to you. Thus, you can have multiple tokens for each user, and they will all be active until expiration.

An authentication token's lifetime is 24 hours. 
{% endhint %}

### Overview

An authentication token for a particular user can be generated by making an API call to the the following URL:

```text
APIBaseURL + /token
```

The header of this request must contain the following three parameters:

**1. Et-App-Key**. This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.

**2.** **Username**. This is the username of the user on whose behalf all future requests will be made.

**3. Password**. This is the password of the user on whose behalf all future requests will be made.

### Response

In response to this API request, you'll receive a JSON file that contains the token. Here's an example of such response:

```javascript
{
    "State": "Succeeded",
    "Token": "FAKETokenAAKTQZR0F5K0OY5sfsWcd9rwAAAAACAAAAAAAQZgA/M8HtnoEJR0UxEDagAAAAAOgAAAAAIAACAAAACApaOit8LbBxTVxJXceMgzvN+"
}
```

### Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when requesting a token:

#### Failing to Specify the Et-App-Key Parameter

If you specify the wrong Et-App-Key parameter or fail to include it in the header altogether, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "error": "Application key is not defined or does not exist"
}
```

#### Incorrect or Missing User Credentials

If you specify the wrong user credentials or fail to include them in the request header, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
    "State": "Failed",
    "Step": "BaseAuthentication",
    "Reason": "Invalid credentials"
}
```

In the following article we outline in detail all of the required and optional header parameters, the range of response status codes, as well as a comprehensive list of all possible responses.
