# Account View

### Introduction

The last tab of AutoShares Mobile — **Account** — is responsible for displaying comprehensive information about the current trading account as well as enabling you to change the app's settings. Here you can quickly glance at the current market value of the account, track the profit and loss figures, take a closer look at your current buying power, configure notifications, etc.

### Exploring the Account Tab

Once you open the Account tab, the first thing you encounter is the account value chart that displays the current market value of the trading account. Rotating the device will expand the chart to full screen, giving you a more spacious view of the historical value of the trading account.
