# Trade View

### Introduction

AutoShares Mobile offers full-fledged functionality for trading, enabling traders to open positions in both stocks and options. Whether a trader wants to open a long, short, or buy-to-cover position, they can do so by tapping on the **Trade** button in the top-right corner.

Alternatively, traders can place a trade straight from the **Quotes** view by tapping on the **Quick Trade** text field.

From there, specify the ticker symbol of the required security and tap on the correct entry in the list.

You will be re-directed to the Quote view from the first screenshot where you can tap and **Trade** and proceed to specify the details of the new order. The range of parameters to be specified is different for stocks and options, each covered in its own article:

* Stock trading:
