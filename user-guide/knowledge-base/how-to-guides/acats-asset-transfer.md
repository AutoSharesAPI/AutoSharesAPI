# ACATS Asset Transfer

## Introduction

Welcome to the ACATS asset transfer guide. This guide provides a description and instructions on the ACATS Asset Transfer feature within the ETNA trade platform.&#x20;

ACATS stands for Automated Customer Account Transfer Service. It is a system developed by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) that facilitates the transfer of securities assets between brokerage firms on behalf of investors. Through ACATS, investors can transfer their assets from one brokerage firm to another without the need to liquidate and repurchase the assets.

With the ACATS integration, investors can seamlessly transfer their assets from one brokerage company to another that operates on the ETNA trade platform.

## Accessing the ACAT Asset Transfer Feature

To access the ACAT Asset Transfer feature, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Deposit/Withdrawals" widget within the ETNA Trade platform.

4. Click the "Transfer Account" button to initiate the transfer process.

Once you have clicked the "Transfer Account" button, a form will open up where you can fill in the details of the asset transfer.&#x20;

## Asset Transfer Request Form

This form allows you to specify the necessary information for the transfer, the brokerage firm from which the assets are being transferred, account information: account number, title, type, SSN/TIN, and type of transfer: full or partial.

### Specify the brokerage firm&#x20;

From the provided list of brokerage firms, please select the specific firm from which you are transferring the assets. If the firm is available in the list, simply click on its name to select it.

In case the brokerage firm is not listed, please utilize the search functionality to find the firm by typing its name or relevant keywords. The system will search for matching results and display them for you to choose from.

Once you have selected the brokerage firm, click on the "Next" button to proceed. This will open a new view where you can provide detailed information about the account from which the assets are being transferred.

### Enter account Info

To proceed with the asset transfer, enter the relevant account information. Please note that the account can differ based on the provided SSN (Social Security Number) or TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number).&#x20;

If you are dealing with a joint account, please provide the secondary SSN or TIN associated with the account.&#x20;

When filling out the transfer form, please pay close attention to all the required fields and provide accurate information. &#x20;

After completing the form, you can proceed to specify the transfer type, whether it is a full transfer or a partial transfer, by clicking the "Next" button.

### Choose the transfer type&#x20;

In the transfer type form, indicate whether it's a full transfer or a partial transfer.&#x20;

A full transfer refers to the transfer of all assets held in a specific account from one brokerage firm to another. It involves moving the entire portfolio of securities and cash to the new account on the ETNA Trade platform. This type of transfer is suitable when an investor wants to consolidate all their assets into a single account or transition their entire investment portfolio to a new brokerage.

A partial transfer, on the other hand, involves transferring only specific assets or a portion of the holdings from one brokerage account to another. Investors may choose a partial transfer when they want to retain certain investments with their current brokerage while moving specific assets to the ETNA Trade platform. This gives them the flexibility to manage their investments across multiple accounts or gradually transition their portfolio to a new brokerage.

#### Full transfer

If you are opting for a full transfer, select the full transfer option and click the "Submit" button to complete the form.

#### Partial transfer

&#x20;![](../../../.gitbook/assets/transfer\_type\_partial.png)

For a partial transfer, you will also need to provide additional details such as the total amount of cash to be transferred, the type of cash transfer (debit or credit) and the specific assets to be transferred.&#x20;

After completing the form and submitting your transfer request, a new view will open to inform you that your submission is being processed. Once the processing is complete, the window will automatically close, and you will be redirected back to the Deposit/Withdrawals widget.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is important to note that the asset transfer has not been completed at this stage. The submission serves as a request for the asset transfer, which will be reviewed and verified by a broker. The broker will then send the request to ACATS for further processing.
