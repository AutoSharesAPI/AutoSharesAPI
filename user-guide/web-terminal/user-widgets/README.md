# User Widgets

### Introduction

ETNA Trader comes with a variety of widgets that you can use to get the most productive trading experience. The goal behind "Add Widget" tab is to make sure there is a place where you could always have easy access to all trading tools. ETNA Trader's widgets appear on the right-hand side of the platform and are always there no matter what tab is currently opened. If you donâ€™t want them taking up space, you can always collapse them by clicking **Save Layout**.
