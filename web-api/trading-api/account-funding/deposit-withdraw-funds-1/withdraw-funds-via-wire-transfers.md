# Withdraw Funds via Wire Transfers

### Introduction <a href="#withdrawing-funds-with-checks" id="withdrawing-funds-with-checks"></a>

This POST endpoint enables you to withdraw funds from your trading account by means of a domestic or foreign wire transfer.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Wire transfers are available only for withdrawing funds.
{% endhint %}

There are five required parameters that must be provided in the request:

1. **Et-App-Key** (header). This is the unique key of your app that identifies your app when communicating with our service. Contact your administrator to get this key.
2. **Authorization** (header). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../../authentication/). The value of this header must have the following format: `Bearer BQ898r9fefi` (`Bearer` + 1 space + the token).
3. **API version** (path). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".
4. **accountId** (path). This is the [internal identifier](../../user-accounts/list-users-accounts.md) of the trading account in AutoShares.
5. **model** (body). This is a JSON file containing detailed information about the wire transfer.

#### Body Syntax

The body of the request represents a JSON file containing all required parameters for performing the withdrawal.
