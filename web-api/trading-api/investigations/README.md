# Investigations

In this section, we'll talk about the Investigations API endpoints, which are used for overseeing account verifications and appeals.

When users open an account, it undergoes a verification process conducted by a clearing firm, which may encompass various investigations. Users have the capability to explore these investigations, dive into their details, create appeals for rejections, and decline submitted appeals.

Now, let's take a closer look at these endpoints:

[Get an Account's Investigations](get-an-accounts-investigations.md): Retrieve a comprehensive list of investigations linked to a specific account.

[Get a Request's Investigation Details](get-a-requests-investigation-details.md): Access details of a specific investigation request.&#x20;

[Accept a New Appeal](accept-a-new-appeal.md): Initiate the approval process for a newly submitted appeal by an account holder.&#x20;

[Appeal a Rejection](appeal-a-rejection.md): Submit an appeal in response to the rejection of an investigation.&#x20;

[Reject a New Appeal](reject-a-new-appeal.md): Utilize this endpoint to dismiss a newly submitted appeal.&#x20;

These Investigations API endpoints empower users to effectively oversee investigations, manage disputes, and ensure the compliance and integrity of their accounts within our platform.\
