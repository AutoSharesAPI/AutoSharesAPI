# Get User's Trading Settings

## Overview

This GET endpoint enables you to request a user's default trading

settings by providing their unique identifier in the header. In response, you'll receive a JSON file with the user's information.

There are four required parameters that must be provided in the request:



1. **Authorization** (header). This is the authorization token from the very first [token request](../authentication/requesting-tokens/). The value of this header must have the following format: `Bearer BQ898r9fefi` (`Bearer` + 1 space + the token).
2. **userID** (path). This is the internal ID of the user whose settings you'd like to retrieve. If you're sending the request on behalf of the user whose authorization token is used to perform the request, set this parameter to `@me`.
3. **API version** (path). Unless necessary, leave it at "1.0".

The user information request must be sent to the following URL:

```
GET apiURL/v1.0/users/{userID}/settings/trading
```

## Response

## Common Mistakes

Here are some of the common mistakes that developers make when requesting a user's trading settings:

### Specifying ID of a Non-Existent User

If you specify the ID of a non-existent user, you'll get the following error:

```javascript
{
  "Model": null,
  "Errors": [
    "User or user layout is not found"
  ],
  "StatusCode": 400,
  "IsSucceed": false
}
```
