# Password Expiration

### Overview

In ETNA Trader, the broker may have configured a security policy whereby users' passwords automatically expire after a certain period. After expiration of their password, if a trader attempts to [log in](../authentication/) via API, they will receive a token that should later be used in the following endpoint to update the password:

{% content-ref url="3.-update-the-password.md" %}
[3.-update-the-password.md](3.-update-the-password.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
